<h1>Hello World!</h1>
Hey there! I'm Ewan, a wannabe programmer in the games industry!
It's not much right now, but one day this blog will be full of all sorts of awesome projects

Nice to have you here :D

At the moment, Here's my roadmap from now until October (Generated by [time.graphics](https://time.graphics/editor))

>![Image of Project Milestones Chart Aug - Oct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EwanBurnett/ewanburnett.github.io/master/Resources/MilestoneTimeline/Milestones-Sept-Oct-2021.png)

- August 20th - Triangle Demo 
- August 23rd - Box Demo
- August 30th - Hills Demo
- September 1st - Begin 2D Platformer project
- September 6th - Shapes Demo
- September 13th - Mesh Demo
- September 20th - Wave Demo
- September 27th - Lighting Demo
- October 4th - Lit Mesh Demo

Keep in mind that these are weekly milestones; I'm aiming to complete each demo before the due date. Since I'm a University student, I may need to prioritize coursework over these Demos. However I'll try my best to get them all out on time!

Each demo will come accompanied with a blog post, talking about what I've done, the process of implementation, and what I've learned from the project.

Anyway, aside from that, I'll also be posting blogs about programming related activities I get up to, miscellaneous projects and things I find interesting. 

That's all I have for now - but expect some project updates soon

Thanks for sticking around!

-Ewan
